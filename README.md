# Next Static Boilerplate

Next Static Boilerplate is a starter template for creating static websites with Next.js, a popular React framework. This boilerplate is designed to provide a solid foundation for building fast, efficient, and SEO-friendly static websites using modern web development tools and best practices.

## Features

- **Next.js**: Utilizes the power of Next.js for server-side rendering, routing, and code splitting.
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Generates static HTML files at build time for improved performance and SEO.
- **React**: Built with React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Integrated with Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development with utility-first CSS.
- **DaisyUI**: Includes DaisyUI, a component library for Tailwind CSS, for building beautiful and responsive designs.
- **Prettier & ESLint**: Includes Prettier and ESLint configurations for code formatting and linting.
- **PostCSS**: Utilizes PostCSS for processing CSS with JavaScript.
- **Husky & lint-staged**: Pre-configured with Husky and lint-staged for running pre-commit checks.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kuraykaraaslan/next-static-boilerplate.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd next-static-boilerplate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Development

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server at `http://localhost:3000` by default.

### Production Build

To generate a production build of your website, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate optimized static files in the `out` directory.

### Deployment

You can deploy the contents of the `out` directory to your preferred hosting platform. Since Next.js generates static files, you can use any static site hosting service, such as Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, or AWS S3.
